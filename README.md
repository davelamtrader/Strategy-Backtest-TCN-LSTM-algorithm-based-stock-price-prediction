# Strategy-Backtest-TCN-LSTM-algorithm-based-stock-price-prediction
This code provides a comprehensive framework to replicate the proposed TCN-LSTM model and used it as a signal generator for the strategy backtest. 

The provided conceptual code for backtesting.py and the complete model implementation serve as a strong foundation for building such a system. 

The key is to integrate the prediction loop (running the model for all stocks) with the portfolio management and execution logic at each rebalancing step.
